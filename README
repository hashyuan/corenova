The only truth in the world is that it is incomprehensible.
Following that, there are two ways of life: to care, and to not.

Is humanity to be against the natural order?
Is pursuit of the unknowable greater than the negligence of?

I'm not sure why I created the corenova-framework.  I started with a
grand vision, yet I am no longer able to recall why I undertook such a
task, nor how it may be of use to anyone.

One of the fallouts of corenova-framework was that it made it possible
to create an universial binary.

Maybe an universial binary is a misnomer.  It is actually like an
interpreter, except it is not a programming language.  I'm quite
uncertain what to call it.  So I'll just call it an universial binary.

The heart of corenova-framework is that it is simply a *transformation
engine*.

The premise of corenova-framework is that it is possible to represent
a software construct as discrete set of transformations.

So, in essence, by creating these snippets of code that perform a
specific *transformation*, and encapsulating them as dynamically
loadable library, you can have a single universial binary that can
*be* any program you want it to be.

All you require is a blueprint of the transformation path, created by
hand in the form of a file, or generated on the fly by interactive
prompt, or auto created by blueprint generators, and the universial
binary can read the blueprint, and attempt to resolve the
transformation path from its set of transformation modules.

I've envisioned a world where *programming software* is possible
without writing a single line of code, where it can take place
real-time, and where it can evolve and modify itself during run-time.

Whether corenova-framework is the answer is anyone's guess.  It's a
single instance of my attempt at an answer.
