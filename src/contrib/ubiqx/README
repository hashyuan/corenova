    Thank you for downloading the ubiqx utility library!
   
    Please read the file 'COPYING.LIB' for license information, and please
    let me know how the tools work for you. The more I hear from people
    who use this code the more I'm encouraged to write. 
   
    Compilation instructions are in the file 'Compiling', and the
    accompanying 'Makefile'. These were both contributed by Thomas in
    Finland. (Thanks for all of the help and encouragement, Thomas!)
